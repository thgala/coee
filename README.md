## The College of Extraordinary Experiences

We live in the Experience Economy and our over-growing expectations for bonding, meaning, personal development and well-being need a new approach in order to stand out and avoid becoming commoditised. The College is a designed experience journey that aims to equip participants with the mindset, insights and network to step in the Experience Economy and design something truly extraordinary.
